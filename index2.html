            <p>Hey there, my name is Alina Herman and yes, I know exactly how you're feeling.

                <br>
            </div>
        <p class="text-left italic">I was running Real Estate brokerage with my husband and we had lenders calling us every week asking for referral business. Even though we recommend our lenders to  our clients, buyers often want to use somebody they are familiar with already. They didn’t know the lender we are recommending to them and had no desire to pick up a phone to call. They wanted a quick online page to start the process.<button class="read-more" onclick="myFunction()">Read More..</button></p>

        <div id="myDIV">
            <p class="text-left italic">We thought if our lenders can market to our clients and keep our client’s confidentiality, this would work really well! We wanted a way to have collaborate with partners so that we both could close more transactions!</p>

        <p class="text-left">These days, I've managed to achieve quite a bit of success... I'm able to click a few buttons and get the phone to ring, I can also know that every month I’m going to get a batch of fresh deals, and I'm very lucky in that I can do it without logging into 5 different websites. It just works.</p>

        <p class="text-left">But I'll be honest...</p>
        <h4>Things Definitely Didn't Start Out This Way...</h4>
        <p class="text-left">
            Before I ever achieved even a tiny taste of success, there were a lot of roadblocks. So many times I was ready to throw in the towel.
        </p>
        <p class="text-left">
            When I first started out...
        </p>
        <p class="text-left italic">
            We lost too many deals because our clients used the wrong lender and were not able to close on time. It seemed like there was nothing we could do about it. We noticed that our clients use lenders they found online and didn’t actually know them personally. 
        </p>
        <p class="text-left italic">
            I felt like we were not doing our job right and there must be a better way. 
        </p>
        <p class="text-left">
            I would stay up at night thinking what we could do to create the perfect co-marketing plan that we needed.
        </p>
        <p class="text-left">
            Of course, you know exactly what I'm talking about, right?
        </p>
        <p class="text-left">
            But what if you didn’t have to hope for a better way??
        </p>
        <p class="text-left">
            What if you could get in front of borrowers and homeowners that your agent is working with already?
        </p>
        <p class="text-left">
            What if you could market to an agent's leads and sphere of influence without spending hours on website setup or postcard creation? 
        </p>
        <p class="text-left">
            How awesome would it be to capture leads online and pay only half the marketing cost?
        </p>
        <p class="text-left">
            Wouldn’t you rather stay in control of your monthly marketing spending with co-marketing while remaining compliant with RESPA?
        </p>
        <p class="text-left">
            Lucky for you you don’t have to say at square one every month.
        </p>

        <h4>Just Before I Was Ready to Give Up, A Stroke of Luck Changed Everything.</h4>
        <p class="text-left">
            I was just about at that point of paying someone thousands of dollars to save my sanity but realized that the best way to create the perfect platform would be to build it myself. 
        </p>
        <p class="text-left">
            ABOUT ME: My background is in technology and marketing, so when I applied my skills to my husband's real estate agent business. He went from 5 clients a year from referrals to full-time real estate broker with over 50 transactions a year! 
        </p>
        <p class="text-left">
            I know how hard it is to build a real estate business and how expensive marketing can be. I have learned a few very expensive lessons over time helping run my husband's marketing and tech department.
        </p>
        <p class="text-left">
            My mission now is to help as many busy Real Estate Service Pros as I can.  I know what it means to work day and night doing the work of 10 people.
        </p>
        <p class="text-left">
            I would love an opportunity to learn about your business and your main goals and obstacles. 
        </p>
        <br>
        
        <p class="text-left">
            Since then, I've spoken with other lenders who encountered the same, never-ending battle I went through. And it seemed pretty unfair to keep it to myself... especially since it's been such a huge stepping stone in our success.
        </p>
        
          </div>
          <p class="text-left">And since we’ve done that, and seen some great results I thought I’d share it with more lenders.
          </p>
        <p class="text-left">
            So I'd like to let you in on the "secret."

        <p class="text-left">I'll be honest, you could skip over this offer today and keep hoping and waiting. But you'd have to shell out at least $1500 for marketing on your own every month just to get a portion of the results. 
            </p>
        <p class="text-left">You won't have to pay anywhere near that amount today. </p>
        <p class="text-left">In fact,  you’re getting what most lenders would pay thousands a month for if they did it on their own. .</p>

                <p>When this offer is gone, it’s gone. Once an agent secures a lender as their primary partner we won't reach out about it again because we’ll have a commitment already.</p>
                <p>
                    I'm doing this because I truly believe this is the best mutually beneficial way of working together, lenders like you and agents, to create income for years to come.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Not to worry though.

                <p>You're protected by my  money-back guarantee. If for any reason at all you're not completely satisfied, get in touch with our team and we will give you a complete refund. It's that simple.</p>
                <p>I'm stoked for you to jump in and get started working with me. Even more so, I can't wait for you to see the results that are waiting for you on the other side. </p>
